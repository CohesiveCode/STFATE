# STFATE
My cool new project!

Implementation Plan
* Read part 1
* Read part 2
* Determine what numerical method was used in its initial implementation

* Determine if there any libraries that I can use to speed up:
    - Development
    - Testing
    - Implementation
    - Documentation

* It's more important to get a working version rather than clean code

* Write out the general equations and structure of the code either on paper on in latex. might be able to use AI at this stage to develop something that will work

* Start with a small scale and work up from there. Build an intuition for how the model works on a small scale and integrate more complicated additoins as you go.
