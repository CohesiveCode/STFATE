  # This is your fpm(Fortran Package Manager) manifest file
  # ("fpm.toml"). It is heavily annotated to help guide you though
  # customizing a package build, although the defaults are sufficient
  # for many basic packages.
  #
  # The manifest file is not only used to provide metadata identifying
  # your project (so it can be used by others as a dependency). It can
  # specify where your library and program sources live, what the name
  # of the executable(s) will be, what files to build, dependencies on
  # other fpm packages, and what external libraries are required.
  #
  # The manifest format must conform to the TOML configuration file
  # standard.
  #
  # TOML files support flexible use of white-space and commenting of the
  # configuration data, but for clarity in this sample active directives
  # begin in column one. Inactive example directives are commented
  # out with a pound character ("#") but begin in column one as well.
  # Commentary begins with a pound character in column three.
  #

  # project Identification
  #-----------------------
  # We begin with project metadata at the manifest root. This data is designed
  # to aid others when searching for the project in a repository and to
  # identify how and when to contact the package supporters.

name = "STFATE"
  # The project name (required) is how the project will be referred to.
  # The name is used by other packages using it as a dependency. It also
  # is used as the default name of any library built and the optional
  # default executable built from app/main.f90. It must conform to the rules
  # for a Fortran variable name.

version = "0.1.0"
  # The project version number is a string. A recommended scheme for
  # specifying versions is the Semantic Versioning scheme.

license = "MIT"
  # Licensing information specified using SPDX identifiers is preferred
  # (eg. "Apache-2.0 OR MIT" or "LGPL-3.0-or-later").

maintainer = "jonathanm@vt.edu"
  # Information on the project maintainer and means to reach out to them.

author = "WaveHello"
  # Information on the project author.

copyright = "Copyright 2020 Jonathan Moore"
  # A statement clarifying the Copyright status of the project.

description = "Implementation of the STFATE model for simulating dredge material transport and fate in aquatic environments."
